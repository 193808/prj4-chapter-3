		Hi! This is my first attempt of making a webpage. I hope this works out. I am doing this as an assignment for <a href="https://www.buas.nl/" target="_blank">my university</a>.<br> 
		Below you see a beautiful picture of the Eiffel Tower I found on the internet.<br>
		I also pasted some interesting facts about it next to the picture in case you are interested.</p>

			Fun fact: I have seen the Eiffel Tower once and actually stood next to it. But I've only been in Paris for a total length of half an hour. Funny, huh? 
			Let me explain how that happened. I have learned French in school for a couple of years and at the end of my second year of French class, I was able to join on a student exchange. 
			It lasted for 3 weeks and was a lot of fun. My school cooperated with a city in the North-West of France and we went there by bus. 
			As Paris happened to be on our route, the teachers decided to make a 20 minute stop with the bus directly next to the Eiffel Tower. 
			It was about eight o'clock in the evening and therefore very empty. We all jumped out with our tired faces and baggy and comfy clothes and took pictures. 
			After that, we kept on heading west. 
			I enjoyed my stay in France a lot and I hope to once go to Paris only to explore the city in its whole.
